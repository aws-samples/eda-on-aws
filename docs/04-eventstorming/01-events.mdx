The first step in any EventStorming session is crowdsourcing events. Individuals brainstorm events
and write them down on orange sticky notes. To get started, think about the first and last events in
your problem domain.

As an example, when modeling "onboarding users" the first domain event could be `name entered` and
the last event may be `converted to active`. There will be many more events between theses starting
and ending events. Everyone's job is to brainstorm what those events without worrying about naming
them right, duplicates or ordering.

This begs the question: what is an event? In event-driven architecture we define an event as:

<PersonQuote>
  Event: something that a domain expert cares about. Immutable facts that have occurred in the past.
</PersonQuote>

Events are written in the past tense. They are facts that have already occurred and cannot be
changes. What constitutes a domain event is defined by you and your domain experts. What may be
irrelevant in one problem domain may be important in another.

As an example, is a user scrolling the to bottom of a webpage a domain event? If you are operating
in the domain of e-commerce, it's unlikely you may care about this? HOwever, if you're building a
web analytic platform, a user scrolling to the bottom of the page may be very important. It's up to
you and the other domain experts to decide what is a domain event.
