# Inviting the right people

Before anything else it's critical to find and get buy-in from a diverse set of domain experts from
across your organization. A domain expert is anyone with knowledge of the problem domain that you'll
be EventStorming. Domain experts can reside anywhere in your organization and are independent from
job role and title.

<PersonQuote author="Alberto Brandolini" url="https://leanpub.com/introducing_eventstorming">
  To run a successful workshop, you'll need to have the right people on board: a mix of knowledge
  and curiosity, but most of all you'll need _people that care about the problem._

- Bringing people together from various departments (sales, marketing, product, engineering,
  customer support, etc) helps you to capture the entire end-to-end flow. Rarely does a single
  person know _everything_ across a workflow. Different people may know the start, middle, or end of
  a business process. Together, the team will arrive at a shared understanding using their
  collective knowledge.
- Different people will spot different potential issues or opportunities. Someone from engineering
  may focus on technical constraints, while someone from UX may see usability issues. A broad set of
  eyes helps identify more areas for improvement.
- Getting buy-in across the organization is crucial for driving change after EventStorming
  workshops. Having representatives from various teams participate makes them feel ownership in the
  process and outcome. They can become advocates for implementing improvements.
- You want a balance of senior stakeholders who have authority and experience, as well as
  on-the-ground staff who know low-level details. EventStorming helps to make connections between
  your business and engineering.

EventStorming should _not_ be run by a single team or individual. An engineering or product team
running EventStorming by themselves will miss the key benefits. Cross-team communication and
understanding are the main benefits of EventStorming.

The right mix of people leads to a richer picture of the current state, alignment on future vision,
and shared commitment to executing on the ideas generated. Cross-functional collaboration is
critical.
