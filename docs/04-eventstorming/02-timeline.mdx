Once people have created enough events it's time to sequence them. Sequencing is nothing more than
talking through the order that the events occur relative to one another.

During this stage there will be duplicate events that are written similarly, or completely
different. The group need to discuss the language used and make decisions on what makes sense, what
are duplicates, and where they occur.

In the example below there are four different events that relate to a credit card payment being made
and accepted. They all have the same theme, but use different language. It also may make sense to
consolidate multiple events with one event that represent some about of complexity. It could also
make sense to take a stack of events that you may think are the same thing, and split them up into
multiple events using slightly different language.

There are no absolute rules with EventStorming and sequencing. The most important part of the
process is domain experts exploring and understanding together.
