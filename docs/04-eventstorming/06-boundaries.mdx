At this stage there is more than enough information to identify "pivotal events" or "key events."
These events are where there is a significant change is the process. These are very important since
they represent the emergent of business capabilities, or a bounded context.

There is no specific rules on how or where to find pivotal events. However, there are a few
techniques and clues.

- Look for duplicate events. When a single event is written many times or with various language,
  something important is happening. In the example, "Payment completed" is an example that has many
  duplicates.
- Look for a handoff from one person to another. A handoff between people can show that there is a
  clear change is purpose or business outcome from the events. Look how a `potential user` changes
  to a `known user` in the example
- Identify changes in language. Do the words and ideas between two bounds feel like they are working
  on the same thing? In the diagram, the "Payment verification" phase mixes payment concepts with
  "gift code." There may be another boundary here that needs exploration.
